title: Xenium LLMNR Responder
version: "5.0.0"
summary: Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) responder daemon
description: |
  Xenium LLMNR Responder (xllmnrd) is an IPv6 network service daemon
  that responds to name queries from Microsoft Windows computers on the same
  network link so that you can get the IP addresses of the server *without
  any DNS configuration*.  It effectively replaces an IPv4-only NetBIOS name
  resolution responder typically provided by Samba.

  This program implements Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) as
  described in RFC 4795.

  Note this program has no UI.
